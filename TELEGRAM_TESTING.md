# Testing Game Visibility in Telegram

## Setup Complete âœ…

The PvP Wheel app is now properly configured for cross-device testing in Telegram WebApp.

## What's Fixed

1. **Cross-Device Game Loading**: All users will see the same game on app load
2. **Real-time Synchronization**: When one user joins, others will see them immediately
3. **Database Integration**: All game state is stored in Supabase and synced across devices
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if database issues occur

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start with Two Devices/Accounts

**Device A (First User):**
1. Open your Telegram bot with the ngrok URL
2. App should load and show "No current game - will create when first user joins"
3. Enter gifts and join the game
4. This creates the first game that others will see

**Device B (Second User):**
1. Open the same Telegram bot
2. App should automatically load the existing game
3. Should see Device A's player in the game
4. Can join the same game

### 2. Expected Behavior

âœ… **Both users see the same Roll Number**
âœ… **Both users see the same player list**
âœ… **Real-time updates when players join**
âœ… **Countdown timer syncs across devices**
âœ… **Winner announcement appears on both devices**

### 3. Console Logs to Check

In browser dev tools, you should see:
\`\`\`
âœ… Supabase client initialized for PvP Wheel
ðŸŽ® Initializing PvP Wheel database...
âœ… Database connected, loading game data...
âœ… Game data loaded successfully
ðŸŽ® PvP Wheel: Loading current game state...
âœ… Current game loaded: 8343 with 1 players
ðŸ”„ Syncing 1 players from database
\`\`\`

### 4. Troubleshooting

If users don't see the same game:

\`\`\`bash
# Check current game state
npm run debug:game-state

# Clean up multiple games if needed
npm run cleanup:games
\`\`\`

### 5. Database State

- Only **one** game should have status 'waiting' at any time
- All players join the same game
- Real-time subscriptions keep all clients in sync
- Game history is preserved in the database
