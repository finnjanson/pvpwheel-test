# Timer Synchronization Bug - FIXED

## 🐛 Problems Identified

1. **Timer resets on refresh** - The countdown timer was stored in local React state, causing it to reset to 60 seconds every time a user refreshed the page
2. **Timer not synchronized** - Each user had their own independent countdown timer, leading to different timers on different devices
3. **Wheel not updating without refresh** - Real-time updates weren't triggering wheel redraws when other players joined

## 🔍 Root Causes

### Timer Issues
- Countdown stored in local React state (`useState`)
- No server-side timer persistence
- Each client calculated countdown independently
- Page refresh reset timer to initial value

### Real-time Update Issues
- Missing subscription to game state changes
- Wheel redraw only triggered by local state changes
- Database player changes not triggering UI updates

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database-Backed Timer System

#### Schema Update
\`\`\`sql
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN countdown_ends_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
\`\`\`

#### New Database Functions
- `startGameCountdown(gameId, duration)` - Sets server-side countdown end time
- `getGameCountdown(gameId)` - Calculates remaining time from server timestamp
- Server-side time calculation ensures synchronization

#### Timer Logic
\`\`\`typescript
// Server calculates end time
const countdownEndsAt = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 1000)

// Client calculates remaining time
const timeLeft = Math.max(0, Math.floor((endsAt.getTime() - now.getTime()) / 1000))
\`\`\`

### 2. Real-time Synchronization

#### Enhanced Subscriptions
- Added subscription to `games` table changes
- Triggers game state reload on countdown updates
- Automatic countdown sync across all clients

#### Smart Timer Updates
- Updates every second from server time
- Automatically triggers spin when countdown reaches 0
- Synchronized across all connected clients

### 3. Improved Real-time Updates

#### Wheel Redraw Triggers
- Added effect for database player changes
- Automatic wheel redraw on participant updates
- Real-time avatar loading and display

#### Multiple Subscription Types
\`\`\`typescript
// Game state changes (countdown, status)
.on('postgres_changes', { table: 'games', filter: `id=eq.${gameId}` })

// Participant changes (joins, leaves)  
.on('postgres_changes', { table: 'game_participants', filter: `game_id=eq.${gameId}` })

// Game log changes (events, messages)
.on('postgres_changes', { table: 'game_logs', filter: `game_id=eq.${gameId}` })
\`\`\`

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Timer Synchronization
- ✅ **Server-side timer** - Countdown persists across page refreshes
- ✅ **Synchronized timing** - All users see the same countdown
- ✅ **Automatic start** - Timer starts when 2nd player joins
- ✅ **Auto-spin** - Wheel spins automatically when timer reaches 0

### Real-time Updates
- ✅ **Live participant updates** - Wheel updates when players join
- ✅ **Live timer sync** - Countdown updates in real-time
- ✅ **Cross-device sync** - Changes visible on all devices instantly
- ✅ **Avatar updates** - Player avatars load and display in real-time

### User Experience
- ✅ **No refresh needed** - Everything updates automatically
- ✅ **Consistent state** - All users see identical game state
- ✅ **Reliable timing** - Timer works consistently across devices
- ✅ **Smooth updates** - UI updates seamlessly without glitches

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Database Schema
- `supabase-schema.sql` - Added `countdown_ends_at` column

### Database Helpers
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added timer functions and game subscriptions

### React Hook
- `src/hooks/useGameDatabase.ts` - Added countdown state and sync logic

### Main Component
- `src/app/components/WheelGame.tsx` - Replaced local timer with database timer

### Utility Scripts
- `update-schema.js` - Schema update script
- Enhanced existing test scripts

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open app on multiple devices/browsers
2. User A joins game → Timer should start at 60s on all devices
3. Refresh page on any device → Timer should continue from current time
4. Wait for countdown → Should auto-spin at 0 on all devices
5. Check real-time updates → Participants should appear instantly

### Available Test Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Test database connection and schema
npm run test:database

# Update database schema (if needed)
npm run update:schema

# Test fresh game state
npm run test:fresh-start

# Debug current game state
npm run debug:game-state
\`\`\`

## 🛠️ Manual Schema Update Required

Since the automated schema update may not work in all environments, you may need to run this SQL manually in your Supabase SQL Editor:

\`\`\`sql
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS countdown_ends_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
\`\`\`

## 🎮 How It Works Now

1. **Game Creation**: When first player joins, game is created without timer
2. **Timer Start**: When 2nd player joins, `startGameCountdown()` sets end time 60 seconds in future
3. **Real-time Sync**: All clients subscribe to game changes and update countdown every second
4. **Auto-spin**: When countdown reaches 0, wheel spins automatically on all devices
5. **Persistence**: Timer persists across page refreshes and new user sessions
